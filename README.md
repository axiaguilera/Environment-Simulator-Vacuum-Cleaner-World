# Environment Simulator for an Autonomous Vacuum Cleaner World

This project focuses on the design and implementation of an environment simulator for the world of an autonomous vacuum cleaner. The simulator is intended to be a testing ground for different artificial intelligence strategies applied to cleaning environments.

**Objectives:**

- Create a modular simulation environment for the vacuum cleaner world, allowing the characteristics of the environment (size, shape, dirt placement, etc.) to be easily varied. Additionally, the sensors and actuators of the vacuum cleaner agent should also be easily interchangeable.

- Modify the vacuum cleaner environment so that the geography of the environment, its boundaries and obstacles, are unknown, as is the initial configuration of dirt. This poses an additional challenge to the vacuum cleaner agent, which must be capable of moving Up and Down as well as Left and Right.

**Methodology:**

- Assess whether a simple reflex agent can be perfectly rational for this environment, explaining the reasons.

- Design a simple reflex agent with a randomized agent function and compare its performance against a simple reflex agent. Testing should be carried out in various environments.

- Create an environment where the randomized agent performs poorly and present the results.

- Design a reflex agent with state and compare its performance against a simple reflex agent. Testing should be carried out in various environments. Additionally, an attempt should be made to design a rational agent of this type.

**Expected Outcomes:**

At the end of the project, a complete and modular environment simulator is expected, capable of testing different agents and cleaning strategies. Moreover, a deeper understanding of the limitations and possibilities of different types of agents in an autonomous vacuum cleaner environment is expected to be achieved.
